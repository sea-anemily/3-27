# Toy data
cases <- tribble(
  ~Country, ~"2011", ~"2012", ~"2013",
      "FR",    7000,    6900,    7000,
      "DE",    5800,    6000,    6200,

Run the code below to look at the tables from the presentation
```{r}
table1
table2
table3
table4a
table4b
table5
```

# tidyr


## Your Turn 1

On a sheet of paper, draw how the cases data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **country**, **year**, **n**


tidyr is transitioning `gather()` to `pivot_longer()`.  Here are equivalent codes:
```{r}
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to = "year", values_to = "n", 2:4)
cases %>% gather(key="year",value="n", 2:4)
```



## Your Turn 2
Try the following codes - what do they do? (annotate them with a comment)

```{r}
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", 2:4) #comment
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to= "n", c("2011", "2012", "2013")) #comment
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", starts_with("201")) #comment
cases %>% pivot_longer(names_to="year",values_to="n", -Country) #comment
```



## Your Turn 3

Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}


```


## Your Turn 4

On a sheet of paper, draw how this data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**




## Your Turn 5

Use `pivot_wider()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**.

```{r}

```

# who


## Your Turn 6

Gather the 5th through 60th columns of `who` into columns named `codes` and `n`.

Then select just the `county`, `year`, `codes` and `n` variables.

```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = _____, values_to =____, cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3)

```



Run the following code
```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to ="codes", values_to = "n", cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3) %>%
  separate(codes, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = c(4, 7))
```




## Your Turn 7

Separate the `sexage` column into `sex` and `age` columns.

*(Hint: Be sure to remove each `_________` before running the code)*

```{r}
who %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to ="codes", values_to = "n", cols=5:60) %>%
  select(-iso2, -iso3) %>%
  separate(codes, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>%
  select(-new) %>%

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.
